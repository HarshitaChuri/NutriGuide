The NutriGuide Image Recognition Module is a machine learning-powered tool designed to identify and classify various types of Indian food from images. Built using a deep learning model trained on an extensive Indian food dataset, the module enables users to upload images of dishes and receive accurate predictions of the food's name and category.

The module is accessible through an intuitive Streamlit web interface, where users simply upload an image, and the model processes it to recognize the dish with a confidence score. This tool aims to support users in food identification and potentially provide nutritional insights in future versions, making it a valuable resource for anyone interested in Indian cuisine, from chefs to health-conscious individuals.
